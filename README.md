Sec(ond)[C]ure Password Strength indicator

Recently I struggled to find a password strength indicator that would work in the dynamic way I prefer.
So I decided it could be funny way to improve my Javascript skills and [git gut](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/git-gud) in terms of ECMAScript6 (ES6).

## Warning: This project is in a old state and is changed heavly from the original state. The initial concept lacked of a good strength indicator, so after researching for a valid way to improve the validity, I changed a lot of the intern checks and indicator calculations. Since this code is now used within the company environment, the code won't be public anymore. I don't planing in adjusting this version or doing a new version.

# Strength Indicator

The important fact is that the given indicator is not based on a official formula.
You never can consider a password is safe, no matter how complex it is.
There are best practices to decrease the chances a lot by increasing the complexity
and increasing the range of possible characters.

# Aviable observer

- Minimum string length (#done)
- Maximum string length (#done)
- Alphabetic (a-zA-Z) (#done)
- Numeric (0-9) (#done)
- Symbolic (!$&/()=?,.-;:_) (#done)
- AlphaNumeric (a-zA-Z0-9) (#done) (#done)
- AlphaSymbolic (a-zA-Z!$&/()=?,.-;:_) (#done)
- NumSymbolic (0-9!$&/()=?,.-;:_) (#done)
- Repeating (aaa, 999, abc, 456) (#done)
- Consecutively (abc, 123, stv, 789) (#done)
- Dictionary (RainbowTable API, List of Array, etc.) -> ToBeFurtherDiscussed! (#partlydone)
- Uppercase (#done)
- Lowercase (#done)
- Combination (Combine two or more Observer)
- ..
- Open for ideas

# RainbowTable API

I am planing to build a small asynchronous API that will read a given RainbowTable
in any Format. XML, JSON, CSV, PlainText with seperators, etc.

This will obviously have the highest costs.

# Orthography - Grammar

Feel free to correct my English (I would appreciate if you add a small explanation for me to learn).
I want this to be a relativly easy to understand, use, and expandable library that everyone understands
and not get sick from.

# Issues

Feel free to participate at this as much as you want. I love code quality improvements, so if
you have some insider knowledge about increasing the quality/performance, without decreasing
readability and maintainability, I would appreciate to get teached in your wisdom.

# Versioning

1.2.3.4

1. General Update - This will only increase if the whole script gets a full update (if this ever happens..)
2. Major Updates - If something bigger will be implemented and/or the script is not backward compatible anymore, this will increase
3. Minor Updates - This will be the one that indicates that we improved without and you can update without fear of problems!
4. Fast Updates - Every now and then I will do some small changes.. maybe I forgot a semicolon or I wanted to add/remove a blank line.. I do not recommend updating further than to 0 (example do: 1.4.11.0, do not: 1.4.11.4)
